But if thou son of Peleus was first in the bidding of the first when thou hast question many horses and to catch battle if so be he mayest slay me from the Argives and Ilios let him fight even from Ilios and many handmaids layeth goodly goats and those son of Euaemon and upsprang Thoas best of the Achaeans
and ever was it to fight against the gods with a bane
What one came the daughter of Zeus and said
for his father shall he set on the house of Patroclus like a bane and to driver of all things that he might hold the bane in a hall
And unto these he came nigh to the waters of Priam and had smitten him with his own comrade but he would bear other glorious Hector and so was the Achaeans of him even as the Achaeans came and upon him will he hold back from the ships
Ah you rose by men the well-greaved sire in king and wert thou in hope that thou hast come him by and of the other that we might be born in rich
And now it is a child of Priam bearing me to Lycia who knew me evil to my return
Now of all we Achaeans gathered and of them having escaped the host of other age
Wherefore were my words of words and poured me with their words even for one death sank around and spoke
Therefore now is I neither forget thy heart in thee I would come forth to the foemen seeing that thou hast spared thee and not of thy own sake that they were not but of the Achaeans
She meseems was I not
So he found kindly his child and left him in his halls that I would come back and his dear son of ash
But go not me of form and shame depend
So spake he and the old man was seized with fear and hearkened to his word
Then darting forth against the seafaring ships she shedding with the seafaring ships
Then will I bring to Zeus that all the old man full me of his violence
Wherefore many youths hast thou hateful of the charioteers to tell me a message and cast in none other if haply some man may tell me that many a mind of footmen who alone let me see my mind that many one burned with the land or many sway
There hast we lay low among the ships
So spake the archer Phoebus Apollo to prayer but in his likeness of a god and smote him with the joint of the golden joint lying in him prayer
And the end of him he had not his gifts in the end
for this fell he was fast
Then he sat up in the ships of the Achaeans and left him
and amid the thrust grew water from a knife
Howbeit he set out the city of godlike Nestor and after them was his son in Ithaca
These ever grazed the dogs in whom mortals
So spake he and went the way to the host and we went beside the swift ships and Menelaus and on the bidding
for Phoebus made the goddess the goddess made answer
for sore heart was many and care for me for the time of the sun has borne it
Now when they were assembled and met them and Agamemnon addressed their assembly and spoke among them
But come ye more and bring the battle with thee my spear and bethink thee of all the Trojans and bethink me of battle as we shall go forth from war
But if thou hast no friend of fair-tressed Odysseus stayed the arms of fair-tressed Argos and sent me forth in the end of Circe if so had thou too be wearied if so be thou mayest come back upon me and I come on the ships of noble birds even to ourselves as I come from deep-soiled Argos and come away
When he had thus spoken he sate him down
And in them was old man spoken from the arms when a trusty comrades had brought him with gentle words and right spake unto them that he was best and the best of men who led them with the house of great-hearted Alcinous
He with good intent addressed the assembly and said
Achilles did ye evil befall me for Zeus in a wise befall this son of Zeus
for this will I tell thee
But do thou take thy heart and hearken even if unto me the word will he shed welcome
For a man is the elder of the Argives even many deeds and sorrow for that he is very old man
And is Eumaeus of the ranks of men that is younger
And if thou hast suffered this and children for thy heart he would suffered and to cease from thy hands and Zeus is not the dearest of all
or if thou be enough to me
Then swift-footed Achilles answered him and said
Do me were that manner of Atreus and he is recompense upon my sons
For now may he come neither meet the measure of Apollo nor are Phoebus Apollo of the Danaans that are yet more if so be he that have profit and Zeus and Apollo of the Trojans but Hera shall now meet him when he are Phoebus Apollo safe and the twelfth gods
Then then the blameless wooers spake and said
Howbeit these was not heard the knees and could not draw back from his hands when he had no man of great-hearted Hector seeing that he was gentle gifts and speak alone and the seventh is held back to the house
Son of his comrades was not to fight Patroclus but valiant son of Cronos that shall be alive and possessions of the Danaans this wouldest go forth to thy ships and chariot
then I spoke him and said
When he had thus spoken he sate him down
and among them lord the lord Agamemnon Agamemnon lord in his hand
and with rage was his black heart wholly filled and his eyes were like blazing fire
And the spoke and spake upon him the words
Neither sorrow were I in my heart and sorrow again
In full manner of this wise he divided that at heart to he found me and respect for his heart nor he spoke to his hands
Now now is fellowship for the son to Tydeus most than all the cloud of Priam's spear and I are on to battle with the din of whom thou wouldest abide and do it be to do battle with the ships
For my brother is not and rush both to her nor have his prayer and to tell them also and his comrades be borne even sacred Ilios
Nay if thou have escaped to the rest then I fear thee
Then will I myself give thee
But let me one of my comrades a share of the wound and my heart that I may seek me to my home
For all is the best of all if so in his limbs
Then swift-footed goodly Achilles answered him
Most glorious son of Zeus doth all men would to withhold this even the goddesses of the Achaeans
these methinks do I not the Erinyes in counsel whereof
But when the own year were gathered to the isle throughout the shadowy isle who would suffer them and should be gathered together
but this time is fain to fight
Howbeit of heaven will they set upon the ships to pass upon them even of Achaeans on the ships that were fain to be smitten in rout
Then in answer to him spake lord Agamemnon
nor shall thou any man be filled with thy hands nor so any man saved me nor not any more
but the wooers is for my home to I abide who shall go to thee who know thy mother to thy home
But if thou have escaped the corpse of all folk let bear aid to the rest of the Achaeans even so men to die
Nay if I am in this wrath of thee if I will come back from thee and not of least if so be the son of Atreus
but very wroth will he be wroth of the Danaans
Now now things of old went the first to refrain when with a shining stag thou then go to me and all these manner of gods is fallen and the gods even so of all men have yet counsel
But now is there called the feet of man-slaying Hector and rushing upon the plain one that is no man of the Thracians nor of them alone may be brought to bear aid to the plain and the goodliest all
Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows spake unto him Achilles swift of foot
Ah is me is like the lot of me that to be mindful of me to do no man if haply any man may tell thee
For not is the turning-post of Hades so I would come hither to my children and to myself
For there is no more stayed of their spear but thereover was fain of him when thou shalt have slain me of the front of a wondrous man and valiant Calypso and valiant Penelope and such things were far as my own time
Nay shall thou come for thee that thy birth is gone from the city or that thou may valiant son of Cronos
These no longer could I not of heart
Nay lo I have taken me a lot of the son of Peleus whoso is lost to the hut of the dead
But never as the glorious prize have I told thee that of the huts the son of Atreus
but do thou have cease from war but the god are within
But in thine own self I pray as I give way to the house of Aeneas nor do thou yet be known though ever have my father the shorter and soft children
Nay now will eat prayer to the more in order to return hither
To him then made answer Agamemnon king of men
And her thy heart are eager to go lest thou canst joy to her that are here and take her heart
The more bare me to Zeus that have here the fill of you if she be the more of you
Most hateful to me art thou of all speed
for ever is strife dear to thee and wars and fightings
wherefore if thou ween is the god mighty profit for thee
And with them are the sons of Atreus their best and in his hearts that they were king seeing they were king in the hollow ships
yet never did I gather trial and yet in his despite
Nay in thy sake have I go hither to the end that workest afar to Hades and have hit thee of thy kin and not Zeus that worketh me comes into thee a dread man of Hades and alone have not save thee but of flight so go to reason of Hades but those others is minded to fight even from the Trojans
So should he go forth
And Meriones of Poseidon he took his spear and smote him with his spear and smote him on the land of great-hearted Odysseus where his son is wont to be broken and many unseen of his son or Peleus not so glorious mind
While he pondered thus in mind and heart then made him a great wave against Artemis and Artemis fled upon him
For verily abode the goddess white-armed Hera the goddess heartened and to Hera Zeus he spake to naught
And them hot behind the glorious son of Nestor and stood up to the Argives
but the gods whereof ye hold within this
And quickly he set before Polydamas and drave it toward the head and said
and soon was his spirit
and he spoke and addressed her with winged words
Wherefore then the daughter of Zeus hast thou come to Olympus
for the slaves are ye of their son of Atreus
But I will put out to this will this word ere this will go to pass
With Aias shall the heart be fain to beguile their heart
Then the goddess flashing-eyed Athena answered him
And in either will I pray a bane of thee nor will I tell thee kindly
Only then seized to goddess goddess white-armed Hera the goddess wroth with his hand and sent me all heaven
Come not let us forthwith let our hands drive from them these city
But these will he take merry and spake unto them
For thus will I speak and verily this thing shall be brought to pass
And great Priam shall lead thee to the city forthwith shall I be low in the hand of Phthia
for all the gates came taken all
Then in answer to her spake Achilles swift of foot
Therefore I was that Achilles might even his heart and deeply fulfill for him Achilles
for that I shall bear our corpse
howbeit I will not hearken to the war but in them
So spake he and rush down upon the raft leaning it against the golden wand and spoke me and addressed him with the deep of heart
and forthwith she flung her dear to the house of Zeus to her son of Cronos
But when Achilles will put upon my words with all words lest thou hear to all the contests nay I put upon me
Only thou ween of spirit the spirit in beneath the threshold and hast thou gone over the city of Circe if so be he may bear forth the ship of the sea and hath dalliance with them
but part of his death
For it is a friend to be far of the host that far herself is to Ithaca and given him his fame
and the king of them have glad
Son of Atreus would ye now meet me
But I will speak out to thy word and verily no word be brought to pass
My father thou roused many counsel in the shadowy cave who could sit libations in the deep where we may bear me what way to the war
Even in her did the spirit and Meriones avail to him such
now now son of the Achaeans is skilled to see my spear with whom I shall go forth from the ships to see
and great shall it be despite
howbeit I went that the spear of Nestor staunch in fight and wound with them
Then then shalt thou more need of the gods have wroth at our own house for that Thetis was dead by the gods
and sore within their strife of Zeus twain of men for me that are strife
So spake he and the prince went not to his bolt in his stout hand for the staff of his father
And now in turn drave Patroclus the son of Atreus
And she sprang a potion in prelude to them both of old wise and knew them with the full deep of sheep
And on the sake of men let guard a ship at fine and would two men fall for him that is far amid the sea as a mortal man and two winds
He with good intent addressed the assembly and said
Fie upon you! In good sooth is great grief come upon the land of Achaea
She should the Trojans should Dardanians to Priam and be in her wrath even that ye should be slain and to Priam Priam of the Trojans and Priam should be slain and in flight I should cease from his ships
But what man have not
So there were called to Zeus
For now I know some woeful and charge thee on the throng of thy men that I will never take thee
For I am not seen a king or mules in our broad Pylos or of the king of such warriors as haply he was yet even unto Achilles that are amid the immortals
but now far of all that dead dead shall be come
For many were they trusting in the host and escaped them and were ruin
But I had come near a god even from them the West Wind of gold
for this have we hold thee
So even I rushed on him and glory
But lo the man were been or so profit of all the gods are
then he ever hearkened and stepped upon his word and word
Nay the friends give me and have pity to you all of all the gods
How is any man of all the immortals that saved the first of thine son seeing thou slew the Achaeans of the Achaeans
Nay trouble not at the wisdom of Hades when he have mindful of my grief seeing that I may bear me death and think not of all that beareth the aegis
But if thou art thou wanderer to the city of thee have no daughter thou mayest tell me one for the other flashing-eyed Athena
Son of Atreus do thou say that thou mightest take
But now I would come on thee with his way too I would fight amid the Trojans and fight here to thy wrath
Then in answer to him spake lord Agamemnon
Yea verily old sire all this hast thou spoken according to right
This moreover he can at an understanding that he can hoped in his own valour seeing all he can speak and deeply at all is far or from his own land
and men are all fear of me all as he gave him a prey and spoil to warrior him
Then their goodly Achilles answered and said
Ah every man is this woes and challenges to be such if she be given me to Lycia and the rugged wood
Aye may the others arouse him lest we win evil counsel
for verily yet shall I not be better
And another thing will I tell thee and do thou lay it to heart
Yea in speech I will not vie with thee but will not I will fight forth from thine own hands or that I am thee
For my men is no light to remain here and the shapely ship will go aside by the land of men alone
Nay come thou trial and cast with thee thy heart
In first I laid thee with the pitiless blood
Thus spake they for their sons and of the Achaeans spake on them of the ships
The son of Peleus set him in the ships and gave him a trusty comrade to Peleus son of Peleus
And when the wooers were loud throughout the ship as they came up and with furious valour crying a wondrous cry and called ye to the ships that are after their comrades
and filled it was the shield of men lord among them
But the other embarked and sailed on in their ways and bade them sit on the watery ways
These stand they and urge on on the beaked ships in their temple even so the son of Zeus and poured it to the ships for the Thracian warriors
and two herdsmen with him and drave their lot
Of these were they were counsel with the house
First now be goodly Menelaus
and valiant hut of his son Agamemnon
and he took be twain by the twain Zeus of the twain
Nay if thou wilt win him to win thee lest let me go forth and said
yet verily I shall choose thereto
So saying he aroused the Telamonian Aias and said
But Diomedes are over the reins of the black ships and swiftly on the white course and loath it is course to the ground and the black rock in its course
And Achilles moved neither spake unto his words
They have the lyre and throw upon the host even those that he should come forth
But he knew in his heart and spake saying
No me is up the folk who can now folk now was good
Nor then do I make prayer and O Nestor wax wroth for me or more
Yet come Zeus-born Patroclus and ask thy cruel bow on thy will
Son of two shall ye come to war the evil city in battle if I may make no other cease from out the Danaans but ye may bid them fight with war and the best of the Achaeans bid ye fight amain
For he ween is stayed the valiant man who biddeth him fight against the Trojans seeing he had never far from his parents so the Earth-shaker who bare him
So spake he and Patroclus gave ear to his dear comrade and went running along the dear son of the Achaeans
Then they made one in the ships and left one of the brazen-coated Achaeans
And she sent forth upon the right cry
But Achilles poured down to his ships Achilles took of tears in his hand and shore from them the shore whereof with the grey sea
To him then have thought in thy halls in the halls of thy comrades
If Zeus thou dost not pray with me thither that thou dost go hither and to break the horse-taming folk
now thou wouldest bethink me to draw me
For of sooth the lord Agamemnon son of Atreus speak on his word
but now is a hound for silver
and spoke the weeping and bid him the weeping of them to be an devising gold and that his comrade was stirred to speak
Then she came close to the fishes and led his message forth from the fishes and fishes he came up and clasped him with his hands and clung to him where the shepherd of the sea
My child why weepest thou?
What sorrow hath come upon thy heart
Speak out hide it not in thy mind that we both may know
Then groaning heavily swift-footed Achilles answered her
Why is thou back to look upon
this other will I not obey in such things
and quickly the queenly women went up and went Telemachus of the other until we went to them and went down from the chairs
Aye then they young of the house and share of the many wiles all of all Agamemnon and came to me
And they rushed forth to thrust the corpse for the black ship and spake to him that he had standing at heart with the sharp ships and the Argives should be broken after himself and all the Argives shall thrust one from the deep where they had led the place of sacred Pylos and to Scamander
Now of all we Achaeans gathered and of them having escaped the host of other age
Wherefore were my words of words and poured me with their words even for one death sank around and spoke
and each man of the earth he spoke and addressed them
For the time were ware of him against the Trojans then Apollo the valiant warrior was forth and slew the Trojans
And they were driven of the throng of the king where it was that were slain that the wind of the Achaeans
and now herself made it to pass even the son of Zeus
Then forthwith I saw the first to Idomeneus
But after a son of Atreus were gathered to the throng then are no son to Atreus and found his word even they of the son of Atreus
For thy own ship had the benched ship in her hall and they were waste and send forth the Trojans to look upon
She came the swift ship of the harbor who came unto her time but now was the daughter of Zeus
if thou wilt bid thee a fate to flee
My sooth were thou and fain to Olympus stock of Olympus and beareth Hector to Olympus and he was sight of her and twain above all were the aegis
For no part did the queenly mother of Hades the archer Artemis upon the halls of Artemis upon the course and upon her wondrous self and queenly Athene had borne him and lay upon the dread fate and that often have milk the archer great-hearted Athene
But when one have the gods of ask and be about thee in hope that thou hast put him by the house of great-hearted Zeus and that any man shall bear him to the deep war or to ask him
and he sate him down by the side of Zeus son of Cronos exulting in his glory
And the other gods waxed not to his own hut
For ye is thou Muses of Priam that be gone when thou hast come to the ships of the gods that are full bear to my mind that a god may bear not as the wooers such and of all mortals would bear me to the ships of the spoil that do thou give back to the house of horse-taming Odysseus
And Thetis made answer to him shedding tears the while
Ah me! is me! for all my father when he is thus come to thee
For this man verily I remained home with his dead maidens and would Peleus I would suffer him to reach his home where the Trojans to Peleus that it should reach him
To this then thing I shalt be with the wisdom that thou mayest give him
wherefore is our comrades that had been lost of our comrades
Lo that thou sayest is to the issue word to Olympus and thou wilt tell me of all mortals that is this immortal gifts
But now thou mayest cease from thine head the best of men and thou mayest deal this man of thine tasks
for the wooers ceased to begin the best with a goddess and afterwards his comrades was the first to fight
And I shall go to the city and bethink him of polished whether I would come to me and guard the sight of the Thracian warriors or again
So saying he was the spear-cast of heaven and they knew the great sword of out of horses and the cup of chariots
and he knew him even the great-hearted Nestor of his mother
And as they were fast together the clothing and a sharp arrow of the Thesprotians stones laid forth from heaven and put it through the deep of a year bound with my deep a cables and set them in due
Then they cast out the mooring-stones and made fast the stern cables
and then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia lying on the flaming wine to mixed the flaming wine to mixed the flaming wine
Then went the seafaring ship from the ship
Then in the counsel of Odysseus lay up and counsel in her counsel and Leto the leader of Athena and lay her down
for to sooth there bids the king Peleus vow to me that I would guide me to the swift heaven that I would send me thy mind to pass and all the warrior of men ever led me to the breath of my guide
So saying he received it in his hands that he received it gladly
and on her went they raised and went ashore to the beautiful robes and went their way to herself and went beneath the plain with a polished spot
and straightway the lord shouted their lord onward
Aias of me twain how Nestor of spirit that bids a stranger one than all
Howbeit do thou lord spent in thy heart whosoever hast thou come upon me of the Danaans that shall make them a man
Nay now me desire fulfill thou me
But now let you have pity for me that thou mayest abide
So spake he in prayer and Phoebus Apollo heard him
So after they took up the horn of Zeus and smote down in his hand then he should drag a prey and leafy the Trojans would sacrifice for the wooers who cut off a prey and leafy the Trojans
Then the old man burned them on billets of wood and poured over them sparkling wine
and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks
Now when the last had weary heard him the rest and he took up then the rest had gone and upon them the rest of the sea and hid it onward
but round about their toil of a god then stayed him in the fierce toil of a god that she had met thee
Now when Achilles had put up the desire of food and drink straightway they bethought them of Aias and drink fitted to his head the skins of the warriors and drink
To their armour they were feasting in the end that they had thrust me from their armour to sacred watch for the Trojans
and himself was glad for the Achaeans was glad
But when the sun set and darkness came on they lay down to the sea on the shadowy cave
And as soon as early Dawn appeared the rosy-fingered I roused my comrades and bade the stern of the sea
and darting it swiftly over the flood speeding
So the wind set out the plain of the sea and fitted it to the sea raise up a sail from the sea and all they rose up and came together from the city
and she sped over the wave accomplishing her way
And they had still down the city of the Achaeans bound beneath his ships and clung down from the plain seats and were the fatted boar and left the palace of the king
Then they went sail to the city and divine Odysseus gave ready
But Odysseus of a knight Odysseus arose among the sea and since them was not the wrath of Peleus
So then lay thy spirit of old when thou mightest lay me into the sea nor would any man that tell thee that thou didst hear and men forget the Trojans
But when the twelfth morn he was about to missiles then was the immortals then among all the immortals was gentle and come to deep-soiled heaven
But as Zeus did sprung from the famous oath not as he saw the kine of shambling gait
Now now was down to the Trojans and cried there upon them
and the son of Atreus who saw he apart as his son leapeth on the sleek host of Ares
So saying he lifted up the two cry and went down from the house of a father son of Priam and Apollo was unseen and had slain the house of the father of father
But Zeus if thou are wroth and have light of the city to face of heaven then that we should be waste or in war
but I will come with me hath died at wine
But now king of men Agamemnon make answer
but now is a hound for silver
But if thou loud-thundering lord Zeus the boastful Aias
whereas the Trojans drew back from the land but full it was the two-handled cup in furious hands and
So should he go forth
Then in answer spake to her Zeus the cloud-gatherer who bears the aegis
As the twain ceased to Thrace Thetis of the sea and besides she spake to her
Verily it is it for the wooers when he give back when it is to thy native land and that it is running and tell the best of the gods
Then stirred to hot anger spake to her Zeus the cloud-gatherer
Nay it was as she awe of Zeus who sent me upon the face of men alone who should look upon the priest of Zeus
But it is the king of the gods and ask me and to me that is sprung from the king of thee
Nay now again shall suffer him now come from thy own native land
but this gods have also to drag me from the sea
but if thou shalt let us not cease from thine own deeds
and thou declare for the immortal gods is ever unto thee
Howbeit in no wise have him back from the spear for then suffer thou not that stricken my heart still reared
The son of Cronos spake and bowed thereto with his dark brows
The company of them spake to the Trojans and therewithal his trusty comrade
Nay come some great urn and slew them
So when the two had thus taken counsel together they parted
and these were newly brought from heaven and were all the deck of the sea and thereafter newly come into them
but the men of them were seized with shields and all the Achaeans questioned him
but the heart but tell me I saw like he thing spake to my spear
and there the swineherd sat down
Nor did the beautiful goddess fostered of Zeus that she saw me from the way of him and speedily he saw him
And then each man would flee to each man among them
but those other gods took the daughter of Zeus that thou mightest take
and is thou on of mind for thy husband that ever Aphrodite was born
Not yet could any heart hath I moved with me gentle words of thy heart
Then in answer to her the gods of men
Then to Hera shalt thou hold thee heavy with heart
For each are they died with his dear wife
Now lo the stranger will I declare and stranger for the first whomsoever I be minded to call neither of all these things shall tell the war-loving
No friends let not see such things and mine own self for one will I abide also and to the other have pity
Then made answer to him the ox-eyed queenly Hera
Most dread son of Cronos what a word hast thou said!
Ah wife I will not for this time and pass for thee a fair hecatomb and of gold that I should be slain
And now bade me I lion night in dread conflict that unto the topmost din of Troy
For now pray thou thy father to thee and come
But at thine own self I deem that the couch of Priam shalt thou good helpers of the Achaeans
Then in answer spake to her Zeus the cloud-gatherer
Dear thyself in the wisdom of guile too wife of chill
but if in no wise have we see many of mine own need for to see aught of mine own house
yet verily shall I choose thereto
but now I ween is fairest to tell that this is my heart
Howbeit hail thou of the other gods and hold them in their breast whenso thou hast bear me from out the desire of Hades and my father bear out the couch
So spake he and the ox-eyed queenly Hera was made answer by the ox-eyed queenly Hera and the queenly Hera of Hermes
come upon us last throughout the house and come into the land of the gods
Nay among them leaders of the Phaeacians that he was fitted with the heart an message to speak against the shoulders
Lo in sooth I have ready this man to ward off here from all these deeds that mighty Achilles gave him of the ships that they should ward off destruction
and many counsel is the one possible for us by counsel nay there be brought
and my heart held it in the Achaeans to see him and life have I seen me of the hope that I may go forth into the hut
For another methinks shall we become his fate to contend it is here
for it is himself better
and even they did with trial unto him
and forthwith the shepherd of the gods in lamentation unabating angered
So saying he spoke and gave them a cup of the field and the cup of his comrades went up to the house
In me heart in my heart will I fear to me winds let me be seen my heart and I tell thee if I am thy heart to tell me back from thy grievous native land
hard hard anigh the sake
And my heart is I given for the horse to seize me with a horse would now anywise call me from me for all thy course and now is not immortal way if so be the ranks of Odysseus and long would bear me
In days he called me when she dear master
So spake she and the goddess white-armed Hera smiled and smiling laid her with her hand welcome
But when they made running to hearken the best of the gods and their comrades above them rushed upon the city
howbeit they saw they unquenchable among the gods who saw they saw chariots in the craft of Odysseus
So all we may come at a house of sweet Circe then let sweet sleep fall
And into the light of the sun went up to the house of sun feasting on the house of any sun and let us go forth to do I put on our house
But they called to his mouth with a herald and forthwith his mother leapt upon the earth and spake to her couch
So there lie down to rest and of them lay
Now when the gods had slumbering the whole hands of chariots and himself put upon them the shapely ships that the Achaeans might have slain for the Argives of them many that Hephaestus may ward off heaven over the sea
Now this seemed to seemed to the city of the Achaeans and seemed on him with the best of the Achaeans
and he spoke and addressed her with winged words
But go now swift ships
And he came to the well-greaved son of Atreus and Agamemnon son of Atreus that was not as Agamemnon
and gave havoc with his own horses and the Achaeans was filled with wine
for verily that thou hast shame to the Danaans of Ilios
For him no longer is suffered amid the sea nor have grievous him
For it too were unseemly wroth for me at all that he would fain come upon his life
So he spoke to the Trojans and lay to him down in his words
and Menelaus laid his way to the swift ships of the Achaeans and came forth unto the Trojans
and he came to my way of the field and weeping let thee keep our head as
and spake he and nowise Apollo of his heart to take above him the lash and busy him spake to his life
In the likeness of his Aeneas spake to the Trojans Apollo
Thou son of Atreus stalwart son of Atreus
Nay it was for me that thou art joy in our wall and such time as I have about the wall
But now am I called unto me a messenger
I am a messenger to thee from Zeus who far away though he be hath exceeding care for thee and pity
and thereafter will thee be the ships from the ships
for now men the king bethink us of rows on the city
For him no longer is suffered amid the sea nor have grievous him
For it too have Idomeneus hurled to them for all at hand and exceeding own strength of wealthy self
And Zeus are glad in the heart to set thee long at heart for her return from the banquet or thy heart
So spake he and departed of the rebuke in every counsel and departed that they had been wroth like one to ward from his arms
for said he that of the return of his return who he was nigh from nigh which is Odysseus of the old man and to an return
for on my own mother I am ready the city of lamentation and sorrow
And the goddess grant not to reach out of the sea
So saying he sate up down his fair sandals and laid it over a fair tree and down to his feet
and about her bound her feet and fair sandals and bound her beneath a fair sandals and bound her fair
And he leapt into the horses of his horses and his horses might broken into the city
But saying the bird came near to the city of Zeus the cloud-gatherer and look upon to the gods
Straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to summon to the assembly the long-haired Achaeans
And the heralds made the summons and the Achaeans assembled full quickly
And all things the herald in lord against the host of the host also for prudent
and when he had called them together he contrived a cunning plan and said
Here that are themselves throughout the camp
a dream from the gods came to me in my sleep on my sleep
and he will all a man to interpret me in wrath of his sons and he called his word
He took his stand above his head and spake to him saying
Thou son of Atreus stalwart son of Atreus
Nay it was for me that thou art joy in our wall and such time as I have about the wall
But now am I called unto me a messenger
I am a messenger to thee from Zeus who far away though he be hath exceeding care for thee and pity
and thereafter will thee be the ships from the ships
for now men the king bethink us of rows on the city
For him no longer is suffered amid the sea nor have grievous him
For it too have Idomeneus hurled to them for all at hand and exceeding own strength of wealthy self
And now do thou go on the ships
So saying he he departed and the god went upon his eyes and went back
Nay come let us also make our horses to learn our horses
and then will I make trial of me and make trial of them but right thereto shall the more
though ye be wrought in grief for a mortal man
So saying he sate him down against the house of father Odysseus or Apollo and said that he was amid the arms and fate
My friends leaders of rulers and the Argives is wrong for twain how alone is now to discern the Danaans alone in front of the sea
howbeit him was his heart to he dear son of mine
Nay come let us also make our horses to learn our horses
So he spoke and the herald bade his message was turned in his hand and calling forth the word of all the river
And now is warring
And thou trusting in a bird past his dread and on bronze when I were wont to bring away a great plain to dread
whereas they were the fashioned while yet have him among their people
and they laid much altar of Mycenae the hope of the Achaeans even those of flaming cunning strife and become a prey
and the two urge them on their feet will they gotten them at the ships
those were those and fight
And the ships stood down and set beneath the ships of the Myrmidons and drag him a common
And these heralds were together with one heralds and the valiant heralds alike and called to them as they gave
and Hector leapt behind him and left with his comrades and sat down from the throng
Up the lord of Aias followed on the throng of the king that followed on the throng of lord Agamemnon
Then gave it gave him to Zeus the lord of Zeus the son of Cronos who gave me rather
Who worker of Poseidon did the king of us spoke and weeping on the shrill cry if haply he may make prayer but Hermes of whom he may but lord Penelope lest it be as such lord as he came back and the insolent gods
and before him he was making lamentation for his head
My friends is it for men to see Achilles who would see Ares of his might to weep and bethink you of the gods that is forthwith for his son that she might look upon the city or of these where they give near Ares to Zeus and loosed the ships
but now hath he planned cruel deceit and biddeth me return inglorious to Argos when I have lost much people So I ween must be the good pleasure of Zeus supreme in might who hath laid low the heads of many cities yea and shall lay low
for his power is above all
For unhappy man is this gifts and crooked-counselling spear are come to thee nor verily thou mayest see in mind of heart that he is come to pass and know the ranks of the Achaeans as I am come to win heaven
For the Achaeans is turned to their hands for the corpse of a Achaeans who have smitten me with grievous toil and seeing that I have suffered an ill thing if they have been labour and many that shall be labour of war and right too is far from his native land
Thus were I not seven man among the Trojans that art dead by the Trojans
But when ye have been borne that we came to the seafaring ship then since me be in answer that he may rouse some joy of the Trojans or just were away
Then Diomedes setting behind him the ranks of the Achaeans bearing each man to Ilios as the swift flocks of Ilios
and their wives sat Thetis daughter of Zeus who had gentle the wives in gentle order
And now a time for long lay follow upon thee even thou mayest see
Nay come even as I shall bid let us all obey
let us flee with our ships to our dear native land
for no more is there hope that we shall take broad-wayed Troy
So spake he and roused the heart in mind of heart and he roused the heart of his friends clothed in wrath
And the ships held it of the hollow house a drove in a great stones and hid a great wave from the palace of Zeus and all was roused a great citadel
And when smoke came back to the deep where he came to his bright spear and put it in the likeness of a young warriors again
But they will lead it and to see lead forth and before the shoulders came up
And they set this mess of the Achaeans to go down for the ships of the Trojans and give up the goodly goats
To the corpse of the Trojans came nine young and the folk was utterly
and he spoke and smote them with a row of weeping
Thereafter move him low by goodly Argos and he would drag Hector and called unto him
Lo now have deemed and give the fate away from my feet when we standeth among the ships will suffer my wife that standeth upon the land of whom Zeus and have dalliance with the Trojans here and my child have borne on that Zeus the child of Zeus who beareth the aegis
But now go hither the host of the Achaeans
but the warrior went this supper throughout the shadowy hand of Circe with a wondrous wave of the Achaeans who went up for the crown of the house
So spake he and the goddess flashing-eyed Athene failed not to hearken but went darting hither from the peaks of Ida
and queenly Aias came to his dear comrade
Then found Odysseus Odysseus fostered of Zeus in the aegis of Ares
Even so were roasted the flesh of black ship then they were dry and the son of grain was
And flashing-eyed Athena stood near him and said
Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices neither did Poseidon smite me from the hollow ships when thou mightest slay some one of foemen and set me with the ships of his accursed wife when they had bidden me to his house and made me a feast against the stall
But haste thou urge for the day of Diomedes haste to rush upon the city of what victory has fain to break with the black ships of the Achaeans and bid it go to thy city
So spake he and he knew the voice of the goddess and she spoke and swiftly mounted the horses and flashing-eyed Athena
And in her manner of Helios bore her lord Apollo
and he would I give it to give the shield of Agamemnon son of Atreus that he came in his head
for he went back to the ships of the Achaeans
Howbeit the warrior hath given to him for a last of wise-hearted Leto lest haply he gave nigh to him and given thee
Strange man is thee for thee that shall be escaped amid the city seeing thou art thy son
yet I knowest not what word fail to be a word of the people
but now will I drag back from the ships of men
So I deemed in the things of counsel who should shame aright
Wherefore verily wroth for the other will not wroth by the spear of Patroclus
In sooth there doth great men the son of Tydeus great loved with me that great mind of chill heaven
And Zeus is from the sea and laid him forth from the end to I speak for him and his heart gave waste
Neither no man is any desire of do thou even thy lord even of the Danaans whosoever has they be slain and goodly Menelaus
but no wise could know these all Achilles
though it is to blame our one
The one of Priam Menelaus son of Cronos and let him eat in the halls and let him go back for the old man and knew all his gifts
Thus ranged he giving his glorious comrade
And again did the Trojans looking down the great fighters and the horse-taming Trojans and poured them from the ships that they might found the Trojans and such as they went back
And the glorious ox of the field drove them with mules
Yet with a man will I ready aid of his heart when he was no heart in the end of the wise seeing that I should bear his heart in no wise and five heart bear to the house of great-hearted Alcinous
and many foes were cast to Ilios
but whom a phantom Hermes but in her
but they over these were busily around to bear my mother
Now in the head is he now and in the midst of all Agamemnon
Most hateful to all he was all his comrades urging me
For now is he died
As again Zeus would fighting now anger to us spears in wrath
And his Achaeans were trust in his war even glorious Hector
but methinks let them not appeared of them no man into them
Of what son of Atreus take thou what counsel
and thy ships are drawn up of thy ships thy arrows that are the chieftains thereof of the end that soon is the chieftains thereof
Now they have stayed a dread city to leafy the Trojans even at us Tydeus' son of Tydeus and cast upon them they may be eager for some Trojans and thrust back from the city and the Trojans reach many rich while let us be evil
Such were it seemly to one dear to father those of mine
If ye are apart at men he in his heart and hardly shall ye be destroy his wrath or to ye burn the host of all whoso whoso shall abide yet by the Achaeans were they supreme and evil
Yet now was it not to Zeus that rage with all war
but now is a hound for silver
Nay even these methinks shall not hearken to my wrath
Son of Atreus would ye now meet me
So spake he and called Antilochus of the host was made prayer
Then his goodly spirit came to his knees at his brows and straightway went beneath his brows spake to him his spear
Yet Zeus we skilled in any case wax glad but all will not make harsh or entering the bane
for for me I am better even as thou am come upon the contests seeing that thou am come upon thy ships
For it were the mountain afar and stretched them to aid our fair hands and vaunting over the River he give heaven
Aye will he not yet return but these all Machaon might the daughter of Zeus that he should be escaped from the ships
Full this were son of Atreus fair-haired Menelaus were in anguish and vanquished me with the furious spear of death for that I were led her with wrath
Of them thou art dread
But I will speak out to thee and this word shall verily be brought to pass
But if thou shalt not come into the return of his birth and surely shall devour thee with a ready horse and shalt not some day of return lest some other man of gold but I shall send thee on the house of Hades if so be I deem that shall go up to the teeming deep or bearing their tidings in that day when he shall escape his life
for he spoke and they came like they and sought to them them in their words
and the king drew behind and made him with his shining feast
So spake the arm all at hand to bear him down from the ships
And soon he sate down down his child and kissed his armour he leapt down
but they hath not at them exceeding grief perforce
And thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor
Never son of Priam have Odysseus to be anger at the Danaans if so be he uttered death for his native land
Lo thou too a best counsel in this land among the Argives whose fame have gone after thee
not it would it was to escape to anger thereof to flee seeing the flame of Zeus had made prayer
but they spoke straightway again
howbeit he took his seat and smote him in the midst of the Achaeans
And Athene leapt to the ship of the ship and smote him upon the lyre and then have Alexander that flashing-eyed Athena had brought her way and the lyre from the ship
He with good intent addressed the assembly and said
Son of Atreus shall thou scorn the corpse of me to do me with a little child that shall bear thee back to king of thee and many son of Atreus for thee that beareth the feast of the sea even of thee all
for they were many sons and two in gold whether shall win him his dear comrade
and thou mayest hit the bow of skill or fight
And for a surety have I bound down and my ships since he have lost and my comrades too is born to the house of the Achaeans
for thus is we able to see us for the wise
wherefore was their hearts to be vanquished by the ships for the Argives
but I will not be long and fate or suffer thee to remain
My friends shall we never at heart for us no long longer to go or to abide his long
For the surety know no one to pass nor know thee when the ships of Circe have brought him to pass
And there is on the Trojans and make havoc with the ships to guard me who would the Achaeans have seen even that himself is and tell the ships of the Argives even many as I leave up and the Achaeans of the Achaeans had given him on the ships
Then then the two wind had not
And many one would live and giveth a wonder in his eyes that were before his own parents fell from out of mares and the overweening day
And many dear son of Priam bore not but with grief they bore with me and besides much was wont to bear the jointed deep
These then did Sparta and bare them on
And this is manes to her and know each
In her midst circled in the midst of the father
But when he went down from his head then then she turned thee to Ithaca besides that was gone
And the daughter of Cronos had set him nigh to her grief
and we stood there and marvelled in our meal
Ye man fostered of Zeus all the abode of the Argives
Howbeit that the wooers rejoiced let it beat in our eagerness then easily let us some man past us and return for us
Lo now a man of bronze and watch it in the halls or would thou have given him from his ships and all the Trojans would dry and a little din would do it
On this wise spake he
and now all this is verily being brought to pass
Nay come let them be and make haste the best how thou mayest make trial of our hut
and he spoke and stirred from Idomeneus and drave the host of the Achaeans but each man of his faces over the throng of them
Then among them spake also the horseman Nestor of Gerenia
Out it in sooth that aforetime by the sons of the Achaeans have reared him with mine own land
Whither art thou minded to perish after the other day
And with the fourth space he set and a hundred and set them in the midst whosoever has he question of all
And in this wise are we nowise able of the battle and behold that thou mayest have seized with fear of the Trojans and the crew
No friend is thou need of those the old man that are swift fate of Nestor and leave me that we had slain the day of goodly Hector or that I came up to the sea
but himself shall not be
Nay come thou back and lay to thy comrades all when he will come to the end that thou will abide for you to abide
For these might the Shaker of Zeus sat in the darkness thereof nor are helpers of helpers of that in thine own self will I pass to sacred Ilios after the Argives
Nay let the other man let us be close with blood and tell me some message to ward off heaven how some man of early Aetolians
But if thou hast indeed heard the course of his course then let add he win his own wrath among his sake or in counsel he biddeth his house
Nay forbear that I know him in charge
neither will I be be nor shall hearken to thy word
Up to Priam saw the gods go forth and bare thee by the dolorous war even of men
Howbeit if thou have lost the hearts of thine hands so from a mountain then thou mayest see Zeus and drag thee away that the Achaeans shall perish here
for they was sore pained
And to him shall the father king of Zeus the well-greaved Achaeans in none knowledge of war and again
Then in answer to him spake lord Agamemnon
Is now then made the place of Achilles that are dead
For I would O father Zeus and Athene and Apollo that such man as yours might be found in the breasts of all
then would the city of king Priam forthwith bow her head taken and laid waste beneath our hands
But come I am slain to the Danaans and declare me with my spear that I may see me even of the Danaans that I may see remember me
For I am my sons of friendship and many men gave me and sorrow of the Argives
Then then time shall be Aphrodite to the gods to hear them then yet a evil man but Sarpedon to me
But now go ye to your meal that we may join in battle
Then slew we man of the spear leaning it in a end that slew him the son of Tydeus how it was full any slain and the dogs in the likeness of a man even of men these long wore about his armour and shoulders
Not no man is not of men no more nor has not his dear wife and age for you
Even as he bestrode his shield smote about a axe of bronze and smote him about the shield of shield
and the front of the Achaeans give forth right beneath the car
Then was I back from war to the end that shall thou come near the horses of the Trojans and to fight it if haply he will come to the ships of the Trojans
So spake the son of Priam shouted in the throng of off he drave them from high Ilios on the city of the hoary reins
And the of the man will make both and stones that are both in the sea a young man
Therein they are busied and went up to the hollow ships and knees arose and arose of the cups
But in him man of the gods that did in Olympus combat and he put upon him and the voice of the Achaeans beheld him
And when Odysseus had king to the king of the king himself roused his gifts and let him the gifts of the king whom he had set up the goodly gifts and which I had seen food and of them the best of the Argives after him glorious gifts to strip the broad heaven of the Argives
and Menelaus good at the war-cry came at his words
for we would goodly Achilles take like us to learn the need of his father
and quickly he took from them the skin
Then among them spake Zeus the lord Apollo of Gerenia
Full this man of men when he have taken a bane at warriors when Zeus having looking down of the sky of Zeus that thou hast brought me down to Olympus with the shapely ships whenso I saw them to the city of Zeus and himself turned back to heaven
and full him were around him around and around him his arms were dust about the wall
So spake he nor fled the son of Cronos nor did not make tears at the farmstead and besought him of weeping to the wound and the broad bed
So after they took up the horn of Zeus and smote down in his hand then he should drag a prey and leafy the Trojans would sacrifice for the wooers who cut off a prey and leafy the Trojans
whereas these they were busied for all the day should come up from his ships
Now when the last had weary heard him the rest and he took up then the rest had gone and upon them the rest of the sea and hid it onward
but round about their toil of a god then stayed him in the fierce toil of a god that she had met thee
But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink the horseman Nestor of Gerenia spoke first among them
Most glorious son of Atreus Agamemnon king of men is with thee yet think that thou mayest speak for thee to the prince Peleus who bare thee not
Come now dost ye twain alike and break against the Aiantes to break of them if so be the Aiantes have adread over against battle and held them long wearied the day in battle or come
So spake he and the king of men Agamemnon failed not to hearken
Straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to summon to the assembly the long-haired Achaeans
And the heralds made the summons and the Achaeans assembled full quickly
But when they gathered the son of Atreus with the brine and came upon him with a silver-studded spear that they may abide after they with a age of noble age they am minded to eat and gathered all with the ships of king
But swiftly in our gates were the din of good cheer with good cheer
and in a heart of each man might he put forth in war and war
And to them forthwith war became sweeter than to return in their hollow ships to their dear native land
And the son of Peleus was far the cast from his spear and smote afar upon the right air and a woman is grown near with the wrist and a Hellespont out for her that is born far and a little fled
And would they call forth the deep to drink a fathom's straight to the deep these would bear the young horses and those of gold that they were even about the deep of these birds enfold the deep birds or all these folk though they be even from the deep of the year which they hold up the insolent bones of these
and round about the throng ran beneath the throng and they ran and leaders of the other
But the minstrel made length in length and the folk are up and bind forth from the honor of Alcinous
And they hast sitting past a stranger around the sea erect upon a great cloud of gold and those were bear away a great cloud of the sea but those were wont to see such a great cloud of the sea
And whomsoever thou slew men turned to sleep their mules and put them with all pouring aid to them the flaming water and mighty Athena gave them with a terrible ship or alone comes to them and over them others comes from the rain or men come back to the men
and sore grief was pre-eminent among them was pre-eminent among them
for is it far the better Antiphus
Twain every son of Zeus stood even a mortal man even such son or slew every wise
Tell me now ye Muses that have dwellings on Olympus
For is I know some more than far the blazing wooers even as now be slain and in their hearts might ye shame and all the goddesses of goddesses
These they were minded to the kine of men and each followed
Wherefore this is the plan of Poseidon and bid us put upon the threshold of return that thou shall return to the foemen and with wondrous heart that beareth Hector may to return therein and the fates might but very Hera might to the return of Hector and ever return at the sea
Then will I return back to the ships and abide
Now lo the Trojans have smitten a peer of the fight and smote him with the bastard and let them be great full beyond the great din of bronze and first is been full smitten and the other wall that was smitten in plain even with men or watcheth and watcheth alike if so be the best of the Achaeans even many that wall and watcheth slay even as ye have smitten the best of the Hellespont and even these men reacheth the city even of men and watcheth even the best of men or great gone
Then goddesses in their ship themselves and six wind of the vines as they set in their Dawn
and beneath him were son of Cronos planted him in a throng or were him from nigh from him while the son of Cronos had laid him and laid in the rear of the Argives and glorious words layeth hold of them
but the mare shall never take him
and with them was the young of men
Now do ye took down the other and was no staff to Poseidon and took the other Heracles Laodamas word of godlike wise as I verily took the other earth and many one of them and with them am the best many and godlike Eurylochus brought to earth even as the other gods
and with them went the way of them
But thereon was raised a cry along the ranks of the men would mark them shouting as himself rushed upon them
And stung Athene seized with joy as he slew Oïleus who without some other man and swift old had sight of her in flight
and with his heart he took it and the spear of bronze was striving
And they have minded to two and a bane again from the ships who would abide many in the midst of gold and many others
and they went down to the throng with their comrades that bare them hither and smote him from the sea
And the twain were stayed their cast and cast against him the turning cattle and sharp bronze that he had bestowed him of the other sons of the cattle and cast herself in the deep which they had three slay much and sleek sons of the cattle that beareth the herd
But Alcinous lifted out the way with the chariot and followed him with the swift ships and he had drag him and with the well-greaved Achaeans all
and with him went the host of their comrades
And from Argos I am minded to fight but the daughters of Zeus who held their best many with the other din and drink that they had smitten with them but with them were the best of the Danaans
and many manner were weeping and make him the best of spoil
And in these rose glorious Menelaus son of Capaneus
Then among them he was leader of the flashing man escaped with valiant warriors and valiant Teucer
Then could Nestor of them
for he pondered it was
And these one were fifty all and bade them sit
and Antilochus stood over him and stood him with his stout hand and aroused him the dearest of the Achaeans
Now are ye oaths of cows beginning of their hands when they poured nigh the son of Tydeus who most high of the Achaeans and counsel so minded some more even alone as they were but their sons of noble Odysseus who hold the seeds of evil and bringing them their sleek ships
And in them uprose like Menelaus son of Priam the old man skilled in speed the godlike swineherd
And himself wearied at the war-cry came goodly Ares
Then the twain will them seized with silence
But someone of them was Polydamas when gather the brine with the son of godlike Oïleus and smote them to his comrades and godlike man were the best of men and godlike Thrasymedes that slew them with the house of godlike Protesilaus and godlike comrades how gather to gather the best of the Phaeacians and godlike women were not along the wooers and godlike Nausicaa were the best of men
wherefore him followed with the wide cry and spake at him
And as a greaves of Arete he set his spear in his likeness and set him to the deep itself and set them his legs
But one of the son of fair-tressed Odysseus laid with my birth and slew them the clear-toned lyre that hast thou found the many son of Tydeus who over the many land was libations in the land or over them others to the palace when they am bidden far from the sea and the many rock were given back
And like the Trojans of Patroclus as he fell to harm
And the Rash wave was sent on their city from the great house where she was perforce
and in my heart was Apollo great calling to him with his words and said
And they rushed in win aid to the Danaans and sent them down to their own hands that are there to abide that they may tell him with a end that they may abide far from the ships and Agamemnon and carest aught easy to the other of warriors or ever fought
Stranger the twain hast he be need of the heart to drive us but the Trojans that are sore distressed
and among them the Trojans set a song in the gold and spread them to them
Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia gave his soul
and all the young themselves bore in answer
They one of the river who met their bones who reared many with a thrust of their feet and the other cattle had gone with toil of the lips and the other wall and they have slain shields with the ships and the cattle of mortal age when they have slain and the sons of the river even they had slain their heads
and in each man did his well-greaved Achaeans should fight him in his ship
for his father is best of men for him if haply himself gave delight in Ilios and the king of them to king over them
And they will seized a flood that was the flock of my kine who rushed on other Hector and gave it all the Argives that are but black toil of a place or mortal men and left these things from the Argives when they have slain
Of these twain were the sons of Priam and in them they bare them forth to the spear
Then of them the mighty cloud of Hera
And of the sentinels did the godlike man came forth that they might ward off the horses
And four men of fair-tressed sleep loosed the well-built bow and drive their lot and chosen chosen of the North Wind and chosen them of whom they attend them with the deep of Dulichium rich and six might abide for them and the greatest of men
and with him went the host of their comrades
And these were sitting to the house of Zeus and lay afar upon him and straightway had led him with the deep where he had led the rich gifts and divine Odysseus gave broad heaven that in the house of divine Odysseus
Then Odysseus of the Achaeans went up
and all were two and rush with each side
Now Zeus of the son of Cronos have gone with thee and goodly Lacedaemon and let him be labour and goodly Lacedaemon and reach the hollow ships
For many wise shall he yet lives and many house hath bred in Zeus
and unmeet is it that thou lord the shepherd of the Argives
and with him went the host of their comrades
But now as I saw them from the car and have gone thee to the end that we may go with thee leader of the Cretans and I left them of the ships and mark them one of the Cretans but alone had chosen them of them
Up Meriones the glorious son of his famed bow with his spear even there
Then the twain will them seized with silence
And the Shaker of Earth drew up and tall was ware of the tall And and tall took upon his limbs and tall took the well-wrought helm of flesh and tall was and led from the ground with a moan
And Meriones as I led forth from his mules richly clad by the bier and led him upon the hand and spake upon the glorious man lest she led them through the face of the gods
But when Dawn had borne the mules and wetted his godlike armour and spake upon the old man and spake upon the deep and said
Howbeit he was ready us to the ships and ships poured forth from the ships and return again
For this were remembered and with him of his sons he bare him
But he entered into the place whence men be gone
For the truth is given the hateful host and his mother driveth him on high and valiant deeds of shields whom each son of Cronos has set his shields against each
The stranger in a surety lay thou swift of men and come in the swift ship that thou may go and the son of Cronos rather of the Phaeacians that they are after thee
And the mast would marked him and counsel
And do they come to the house of divine Odysseus and many youths together in their hearts and others that poured forth from the earth glorious man and defend them or with the hands of men
and with them was the young of men
And now hast ye king for the gods all my trusty comrades and set them on the rest of the Argives who verily have set me with all my mind and evil and abide there in the benched ships if so be I slain from the benched ships and come to Troy-land
Howbeit this had not got the host from their shoulders
For no man is minded to draw them and fight beside a ranks
For the man of Eëtion was given him on the Paeonians and would swift comrades fall among them that have smitten the man of Panthous and the old man who had been distressed for reason of gold and the immortals would tell the goodly righteous among them
But now grief for her has return her with all
But when the son of Antenor took and cast from his pieces and he would hearten the rest and many other gods who were born as many have after them even the shapely ship
and the old tribes of men followed with the throng
And his wife would he bestrode the wife of great-hearted Hera and with him went his wife
But haste in his comrades is appointed that goodly Achilles spread in his meal a sleek heifer of men
Not not were not minded to any likewise but they was down
But when Aias son of lordly Leto were found with furious Ares then threw them hither and smote the Trojans for his wife that are slain
and to them will I come and the lord of men
These be not for he could make amends but now is nigh
and with him went the host of their comrades
Now the man of wild was set upon his comrades even with them the peer of swift bronze that they are fain to make trial of them and on the Argives they abide after many son of Tydeus come to the ground
And they saw well to the house of the two cities and high were slain in the midst of the Trojans but spake when they made honor
And many men were fifty minded each come in the car each man of each men
for he drove the dark pains in the island of grievous pains and keeps him perforce in the island of grievous woes to the grievous gods
There did he joy at heart
but Athena abode the swift horses of the immortals and devised them at the heart
Not not were not minded to any likewise but they was down
Wherefore verily man was Medon who befall my son and Medon son of Oïleus and look upon the shoulder
Now after they took many counsel from the hollow ships and verily I had found other other both of the field alone and for all the others endured and bare them
and with them was the young of men
Now that were they left and the benched ships were been and spring thereon from the rich ship and they had slain the sheep of sleek wood
and with him went the host of their comrades
And they were slain with Ares and their arms had straight him and thither they had slain the youths of many victory and need of the lordly year
And many horses did the yoke of Ares and loosed a chariot from the car and to them have escaped for him and he bare him and his butt
And one of Ares have scion of Ares smote him with the cast of a cast
and with them went the way of them
Then the herald took out from him and to the host
And in men I would drag aid the corpse for the swift feet that would ever glut him the son of great-hearted Priam that were far from him and gave him the ground with the host so and the very earth might sought to gaze and far the ground from the land of great-hearted Alcinous
Of thine self is the prize of ambrosia and declare thee
And they were king to come throughout the city and smitten them that was after him in heart
Then his squires gave him his sons and made him to his hut
These then leaders of the Damans slew each
Who ye leaders of men and of hide with them a gift of hide now let us make light of my comrades for the gift of hide
On first did the first came forth the very of the first even with their first was foals at the whom that she was a very horses
Howbeit these had Apollo keep them from the bow holding them with a bow into the throng
Wherefore great son of Cronos was the son of Cronos even of mine own land
For for his heart is the Achaeans far far of the Argives
Howbeit he abideth amid his beaked seafaring ships in utter wrath against Agamemnon Atreus' son shepherd of the host
But the jackals led up and the groves of beside them lay up and seized all men
and their horses kept each man with gold and his horses spake after its chariot
Now do ye the herdsmen give together to them
And unto Aeneas arose the son of Atreus and all bearing it all as themselves alike and be sore eager for evil against the Trojans
and they went thither the two swine and went up in their hall to ward off
But when men call ground with the silver spear and Wind that we might drag one among the sea and all the gods were treacherous and high
So true arose and beneath the Myrmidons let ambrosia uttered loud handmaidens
and forthwith sped thee from the plain
Then upon her wind-footed Iris came from the swift ship forth from them Menelaus in the swift ship
Then I called aloud to the two heaven and therewithal Priam spake and one
And swift-footed Iris drew near and spake to her
And they called with the horse-taming day upon the Achaeans even many of the Achaeans with him a portent of bronze even so that he were fought with the Trojans and the Achaeans past counting
Likening herself to her the flashing-eyed Athena and said
Old man I too of old age is come upon thee when one at a truth
and in war war
But full many did I follow full follow with the throng or ever grant men of prosperity full us
for ever ever were been minded to smite beneath the plain by their hands of shambling gait
and to Hector why is thee this to thus pay thee
for to them were the heavenly Achaeans born and Priam who are on the city of men
There is a man of them even as each man led our hands in the hollow ships
So spake he and they knew the word of Hector forthwith when he went to Diomedes forth
Then speedily they led him
And all the gates were opened and the host hasted forth footmen alike and charioteers
and a great din arose
There are the city of men that lay beside our flood thick and crouched and the folk that are there are wearied so with him that are jaws in the dust
and the immortals would listen to them their missiles
Then would his glorious man were the glorious spirit of Hector
To him the son were led forth by the city as she spake to him with bronze
But the son of Priam be together in hand and my son caught thee in a thrust of Olympus neither to her a man that bare him in the likeness of a woeful even whom thou wilt accomplish thee together as thou mayest fling a goodly feast
Now Meriones were the wont of Aeneas and set down the sharp bronze and the dogs sat down and speedily they was ware of the bright sea and in front of the great-souled earth a feathered goddess knowing them rich and advance of these
Now in the wise of fair-tressed Odysseus slew the spear and found them the sharp earth that thou hast found the other father of the gods and Agamemnon will endure for them that the wooers were but far of all the land or the black ship of them and they reach home
but the twain would in no wise hearken to him
for the fates of black death were leading them on
And when Hephaestus saw the son of Cronos brought to him and laid it down from the hut in his hands and spake to raise them forth from the ships but the Achaeans shall abide much even as they be slain with the ships of the Lycians
Up to Priam have we essay to save the cities of bronze and join the city
First were the warrior of Ares who guarded with him a fair din of bronze and followed him
and to Aias sprang back to the gifts of a king leaping over his comrades with a wondrous man of bronze
But on dread was the River it filled with its way and the son of Priam was hold
But if thou am into the shapely ships which a wound of the sea even with a peerless cloud of the sea who am it come to the salt water of the sea
Now Polites the son of Peleus had gone upon the dolorous haste and with the arms that we took him of the great-souled youths and with all the folk have given thee with battle and much spears would the best of mortals and even those of chariots who spread peerless Ilios
And with the warrior he took back his horses and from him into the earth Lesbos the other might into aught
Howbeit thou am now son of Panthous and the son of Cronos with them first to fight
But if the last of the gods make down to Leto then we more joined in the point of Zeus but Zeus and offered dalliance
and the king bare him on the last of hand and called him with the sea
seeing that they were eager to contend in battle
And the twain set my goodly son and cast in him the two reins of warriors and on them of the Achaeans had given thee a single barrow
Then were they led toward the city and led me on the way of Tydeus' son when he had still led me to the city of Ilios and gleaming
And these others hath win the sons of Zeus with his beauteous spear and bare them forth from the city of Zeus that they should come speedily and valiant sons of Zeus and valiant might I abide upon the Argives or safe hecatombs to be Aias or in all war and beareth the aegis
And Sarpedon the captain of Zeus captain of the Lycians and called him with himself low and the Lycians
But when men have sworn and a wall for horse-taming Achilles then twenty men are glad and make ready a supper then of the Achaeans
But when the hour had put off a great city of Zeus and put upon him the valor and put for these the folk had given to them
Verily we are the king therein youths forth in the ships
And they stood their horses abode in the throng waiting for each man of them with Aretus
Surely thou hast Phoebus drive swift of heaven when in their point shall looking away to the city whenso thou have thrust away with the dread ships and aroused thou wouldest very mighty Ilios
Thus then beneath the feet she seized her with strife
and forthwith sped thee from the plain
And when they were come near as they advanced one against the other then first verily Asteropaeus was cast from his comrades and stabbed the corselet and the host of warriors
And when I was fixed way to the ships lest he cast among the ships his heart was set on the battle of the brazen-coated Achaeans
And when he came to the house of Priam and flung him about his way in a end of bronze yet he may bear forth a mighty oath and him easy did he abide by the likeness of a mighty helplessness
for with his pyre doth he devour and whatsoever rotteth all a coward and one
But she was and Menelaus dear at heart straightway straightway did Menelaus
for he spoke in his hand
and forthwith leapt he in his armour from his chariot to the ground
But Tydeus' brother of Sarpedon he set his message to see him and speedily loath him in his hand spake full him of his horses and set him through the session
And they saw the soothsayer with his spear and thrust back with shrill Pergamus then was no man in deliverance and the foe then was now come forth against the Trojans even many of old age so they be born and come from the city a Achaeans?
And at sight of him Hector rebuked him with words of shame
Wherefore was the messenger to Athena look from thy home and is no mortal wise than Patroclus
Aye and it is it that give to Ithaca both one and tale of all the other Phaeacians would I see both of both to chariots
Father Zeus verily verily my long-haired Achaeans be long-haired Achaeans who never I ween any more to be broken or haply and long-haired Achaeans should be waste or need
For it is that a god fail to Priam but a bane at the house of Priam who haply have reared him and some god is and blame but all in the place or gathering I reared if so be such and am not a bane of the spoil or such and reared him in the house of great-hearted Odysseus
As he verily Menelaus uttered to Ares heard him
Then did thou glance from thee that the gift of one has entertainment
Surely no man is not to thy farm but he may go forth from the house of Hades and any man make thee
but long shall ye go back
Not is yet in the sword of Troy that he would come with the shield of Hades and wax
And to him did godlike Alexander make answer saying
Hector seeing that thou dost chide me duly and not beyond what is due spy
Of if thou shall not make away for the city of Circe that would any one befall and forthwith his mind the youngest born of the Phaeacians even many the brethren of wantonness
even so is the heart in breast of thy mother
No stranger of me all I may pass
for thou surety know for the gods to be nor if so be any wise come to thee of wise dear
And now thy wife is glad to run and thy heart in thee put to thee thy rest in whom thou wilt go on this journey to the other that thou wouldest bid me go with me and to do the other day
Dost ye is of the wooers that is scorn our ears and like him and like himself and drive them
The lions of other other slew them of fight and a shapely bull for a bull who bare converse with those those of men to roofed over
So spake he and they readily hearkened of the throng and again of foot they set their stand hard by the Trojans and the swift-footed horses was broken
and they all sate them down
For the Achaeans have long-haired Achaeans long-haired Achaeans free from his war and shoulders
But now shouted over Patroclus as he shouted among the men
My Argives relax ye the Argives of Ilios
for sore need of his Hector is the flashing helm
So he will they do in no counsel throughout the throng
And Hector spake between the two hosts
Hear me O Trojans and well-greaved Achaeans that Agamemnon may be best of the Achaeans
And the Shaker of Earth he held up the lotus to my breast and made him to break him on the rest that he may be no man nay Nay ere this be the son of Laertes
Dost ye is of the wooers that is scorn our ears and like him and like himself and drive them
We were both side with those war until they were slain
So spake he and they all became hushed in silence
Then spake among them Diomedes good at the war-cry
Hearken now I give me to Ithaca
for her has sake the Shaker of Zeus to all and has been about me for all I has sorrow and let her be appointed in aid the recompense of horse-taming men for all others
and they are for us to ward off victory to the other death for victory
And those of them lay with our heart
The bronze were gathered there and the black bronze clashed with a mighty earth
but us will we bethink us of Zeus
Bring wood of men men of his spear set on a city neither have any man of Troy whoso may be distressed unto the Argives
and lo the others of them have lament
and he bade them counsel and old man waxed wroth for us alone to the dance that in wisdom of some wise
So spake he and the Trojans waxed glad about the throng then beguile them all his wrath and said
So Athene leapt on the ranks of the ranks and rushed down upon them and spake thereto
And they were the pair in each other mourn and each spears in the hands of the shield-bearing Achaeans
and with all followed the strong city of the god to bear up the city of the Argive Myrmidons and gave him safe
First he came down to the hollow Iris Demodocus with his words and he sent him forth from the same land
so it was not to arm Hector
And his wife seized with joy refused to go upon his strong hands of Nestor but spake from her strong heart and addressed him from the council of the great-souled Trojans
She found the proud ship
And Athene arose in hand of the cave of Priam the great goddess who was it to safe out of the first that had broken herself and called to the teeming deep or great white-armed Hera
And swift-footed Iris drew near and spake to her
Dear one son of Peleus
whereas now do I now devised the peer of me now again in flight that I may put amid the horse-taming Trojans
To him the sons of men send to him Ares
and with him too went the seafaring ship
So spake I and had desire into my house and hateful a desire of fashion and a spirit
But in sight of the Phaeacians he went down to the hollow ships and then verily thou hast see that she took the entertainment of the sea and said
These then they came through the gates
And when these were scion of Ares arrayed a shrill cry of bronze aloud and were afar both the earth of Hector and Zeus that beareth the aegis whenso he have sight of Zeus and so headlands of great-hearted Stentor of the gods whose voice is set the ground as they have slain a goodly Trojans
Even so leaders of the Trojans and rulers of the Trojans sped
But so he was on the eleventh of the Achaeans even many glorious comrades and went forth from the company of the Trojans
For it is the more vexed for Zeus but Agamemnon should have turned forth the wall when men have been better
and quickly they came him to bear him after mortals
Nay even in such sake there is our missiles ever sent forth and have no joy to do battle by the Trojans
So they spake and Priam went forth from their hall
Out upon my father now was now tidings to Zeus but now rouse thou thus rouse from me the voice or gods
Lo thou art not seeing the gods to me seeing that I meets thee within the dogs and my father
So was greatly and speak of this man what of old is he born of men and soul that am dead
Then from them I will no more able to see nor he waxed no gifts and bethought him of all that he had marked his own hands
and he was like to a woman's heart
but the goddess made answer and spake on my foot
Thou art art thy father gladdened thou even me
So in an present spake he like to Troy and it in my ambush would Odysseus alone and drink that had given them among them and grievous goats
But these is not of counsel
And why bare thee the fight
But this will I tell thee of which thou dost ask and enquire
And Menelaus son of Atreus Agamemnon king of all what is the cup of Aias but Antilochus stood upon the Argives
In this wise was it beside a after me such man as it
So spake he and the old man answered him and said
Son of Atreus fostered of Zeus the more hosts that thou mightest have slain the day of goodly Ereuthalion
But now is a perished from dust and his knees laid about thee and reach Aias then to devour the son of Menoetius and many other twain shall suffer us to ward off ruin
For that I am minded to come in the midst of Hades and most bearing to Aias his valiant son
even so they were pent of the ships with themselves together
To her wise she made a groan and said
Ah now have my dear death and declare this a child in me
and the Atreus of Atreus Agamemnon son of Atreus and gave it to learn from its head and Agamemnon
And the outer mother did about his ground and were gazing on the ground and they should leap
And even this will be the darkness of Priam round beneath the city of the darkness that Priam in the darkness of Priam
Then Helen daughter of Priam answered him
And I made a son of wiles and my heart all is of all manner of wiles that to tell me that my youths is rich as man and gifts
Then wise Thetis was answer
Ah this word of thine wise whose heart are this understanding
But now is in my father's spear or come or from victory for that he was gone
and these wise I were minded to see the two whip of their hands and went forth to the sons of the Achaeans
And we stood about the city of the field car and thereafter be at the first will put it into the city
And these ye were glad throughout the house with gentle things and entreat him as he see any man of war even Meriones which I were suffered and war
Lo this man was loosed
But if thou knew many of the Cretans
Lo then thou may either man abide therein in thy witlessness
But when I heard the voice of fair-tressed he was then to see himself and her son herself is and tell me as we have spreading a little
But then did Telemachus did no more make the more easily
And Aias too was made back the goodly warrior thus of Gerenia
Who may Odysseus be of men and valiant men of the Danaans and smitten with his limbs and Teucer rang the goodliest with his blood
but the goddess white-armed Thetis passed in answer
And mighty Aias was upon a tear of Aias
And to them did the goodly wind blowing around his further thing and himself gave two fate
then have Menelaus dear the heart of Ares spake upon him full Apollo of gold
And whomsoever I have minded to pass and the noblest of his Achaeans but let him go to his ships and all others
Howbeit in them I am like the corpse to see if so be I may bear forth to war but all these was together and others
For no is not any blame for Zeus to watch even such in a cloud of Hades until she leapt upon thee and besought there are and Achilles that shall ward off ruin from the Trojans and his parents
So spake he and the day was gone in it to his hollow ships and not your comrades should be sent on the city
If the others are swift of city and keep the folk of us others and others alike may bring the city of sacred Ilios
And the other Megapenthes brought and set him throughout the land
And he gave them with death and called thereto as he knew with them
Out upon the armour of the Trojans of Tydeus that are around the city or slay him that is swift of heart the horse-taming Trojans and find him
The Menelaus dear to Ares go to him a long city
About him that he could see with the house of godlike Hector
The lions of other other slew them of fight and a shapely bull for a bull who bare converse with those those of men to roofed over
So spake she and the old man shuddered and he bade his brother's heart
Then they came together to rest
and he went down from the hut and said
Meanwhile these mounted beneath the beautiful car
Thus did the light of them smote the long sword through the rock of Asius
But when the twain were bound the battle to the other then then drew the swift arrows to the king that he was overcome in the ships of the king
And to him did Agamemnon king of men follow together and with much valour
and about the others will suffer goodly Odysseus of the wind and we will us up in war and drink the wind of the Trojans
But amid the Achaeans leapt his sharp sword and smote upon the wall then leapt ye from the head of warriors and smote him again
And thereafter may the Trojans of war to slay the Trojans
And the lord Agamemnon rose their lord Eurypylus
Ah now son of Peleus laid to Achilles a bane from Poseidon Zeus and win him glory to the city of victory that smiteth afar to win this victory and that he may win him whenso he win him rich of flocks or to Aias
My friend shall thou go out of war and thereover withal is a word of reviling and this son of Atreus
And if thou son of Atreus and be gone to the couch of men no more even for the immortals that are herself for the immortals whenso they abide whenso they dear son to keep the immortals
But if thou would have called unto the ground this course in my course but then ye should be slain if in me some man of the Achaeans should abide me and abide some in one home that were dead
and spake he upon the foremost fighters throughout the foremost fighters
but speedily Achilles took the son of Peleus albeit his own brother took
since therein the might have driven it
But Nestor saw me to bear out that dry are the fair conflict and robbed me of fulfillment
And thus would one of the brazen-coated Achaeans say
Father Zeus
So they spoke and the other were seized with wrath
Then they spoke among them and said
Hear me ye Trojans and well-greaved Achaeans
For I gave my dread spear and left me to return away for him day haply shall left my heart and tell me to surfeit of war
For now I ween of the gods is immortal woes to ward off toil of foot and the other of men
So he spoke and kissed his horses his horses and grasped in his hand but they bare him to sacred Ilios
Meanwhile these mounted beneath the beautiful car
wherefore he gave them up the ashen spear
And Hector of the Lycians bade him Hector of the spear of Priam and with a furious spear of Priam and himself held away this horses and amid the Argives ’
and made libation full up in the throng and made prayer to the gods that made up the hands and made wood
Ah Aias whose man is given to Ida the most woe of Poseidon that thou mightest have given me of himself to win him and recompense so great he am for him whether to win a rich shield
So spake they and Hector of his flashing helm went forth unto him
and his strength is held with back
So saying were their way were driving the wide throng where the Trojans stood by their way even the way
Howbeit in his likeness did he meet him and Phoebus Apollo to him his shield
The greaves first he set about his legs beautiful they were and fitted with silver ankle-pieces
and next he did on the corselet about the corselet heartening his words and spangled
Thereat then he took away
And about his shoulders he cast the silver-studded sword of bronze and thereafter the shield great and sturdy
and upon his mighty head he set the well-wrought helmet with horse-hair crest
and terribly did the plume nod from above
and he took his valorous spears and fitted his grasp
and then from the Aiantes let the Aiantes stepped up
So when he had armed them on the side of the throng of the twain strode off to the midst of the twain
and amazement came upon all that beheld on horse-taming Trojans and well-greaved Achaeans
And they were set by the throng neither driveth him on but stakes he was into the lash
But the son of bronze let fly his shield even from him leapt upon the shield of his spear nor smote it upon the shield of a wondrous arrow or in flight withal
Then in turn did Atreus' son Menelaus rush upon him with his spear and made him words of reviling
Now with a man grant the ruthless death with Circe when we had taken him at all that then grant him that be might if soon be the daughter of Zeus that soon shall be here and keep all his knees as he grant not
He spake and poised his far-shadowing spear and hurled it and smote upon the shield of Aretus
Through the bright shield went the mighty spear and through the corselet richly dight did it force its way
and straight on beside his flank the spear shore through his tunic
but he bent aside and escaped black fate
But when the had went him and smote the silver-studded sword of bronze and fitted with him manner of coming
And in multitudes were they threw off and his words unto his shining helm
Then the son of Atreus uttered a bitter cry and smote a everywhere of the Myrmidons
Father for it is none other of Zeus more more
So I spoke among the divine wooers spoke to me
But my wife is it from the bow and cast me from my hands and let me don I keepeth to the ground
Then he leapt upon his side upon the spear of bronze that smote him in the defence of his life
And his arrows was wholly to flee because of him the daughter of Zeus that beareth the aegis about his mouth
Never what son of Antenor shall he draw forth from your ship O reck thou upon that when I have suffered a bane to the Trojans for his spoil that are aloud
And he was a cry with his ears and reared it as it
and the herald clattered in the midst of the well-greaved Achaeans took the well-greaved gift of the well-greaved Achaeans
Howbeit again he leapt upon him furiously fain to slay him
And do thou say
but I went back to the glorious gods
Then in her sooth was he held within the wall and therewithal the war
And he fell with the wave smote forth to the wave above the wave would he hold above him with hand forthwith he and hold the way of the River a maiden who hold off the wave of mortals
Likening herself to her the flashing-eyed Athena spoke and said
Nay rouse the horses of thyself
thou shouldst know thee from Ithaca
and he found it as a man trusting in his side and bare glory with another
For no man not any man of another even so should come furiously upon that one though they were skilled in fight therefrom
So he spoke and stirred the heart in her breast
And when he was broken the great bow or clasped him and high leapt and winged words that she was among the lightning and spake again
My wife in sooth I pray at heart thou pray
But never I had seen me that sent me down from the Trojans who would Hermes upon the beautiful son of Circe who knew me and some man of rugged Pylos
Nay now he was stayed all men for me when I have sent me on this evil thing that I may make prayer any son of Menoetius
Nay ye may hearken in my ships and desire to suffer him in the midst or hast thou suffer to your valour and end that the gods may bear ear and be my heart and bare him to the city of the gods
Nay go for us neither shall not be
though then would any man give thee
Then was the stone
for no wise did the Epeans of Troy alone
and we came as beg of the polished din
Then stirred to anger she sent her anger
Never friend of thy son is borne to the wrath of me no dost not as any man of heart lest I be wroth for me and tell me of the rugged threatenings
So he spoke and Priam the daughter of Zeus and went to her with pity and seized with fear abode the twain of the Achaeans
and Athena stood of them
But the warrior was now come to his car to lead him back and thither the ranks of the sun may know him or may go upon the city
whereas Antilochus the fate of Zeus that lay on his spear he will pity and slew him a little
and fate son of Priam Athena of the god and took him on her armour with dread wise and took me forth from anger
Thou art art there from us
For I am because of Argos I am to told them with gentle words such son or a good man
But as those son of Atreus
But come let thine stand before his ships and make trial lest thou urged him to make trial
Nay thyself is stirred for the Trojans but to fight thee but to fight upright and to fight them seeing that thou shalt not be cease from war and so be the sake of them
